  the goal.  Make sure to implement a graph search algorithm 
  [2nd Edition: Fig. 3.18, 3rd Edition: Fig 3.7].
  
  ****************************************************************************
  
  An informal description of the general tree-search and graph-search 
  algorithms. The parts of GRAPH-SEARCH marked with ** are the additions 
  needed to handle repeated states:
  
  function GRAPH-SEARCH(problem) returns a solution, or failure 
  initialize the frontier using the initial state of problem
  **initialize the explored set to be empty**
  loop do
    if the frontier is empty then return failure
    choose a leaf node and remove it from the frontier
    if the node contains a goal state then return the corresponding solution 
    **add the node to the explored set**
    expand the chosen node, adding the resulting nodes to the frontier
      **only if not in the frontier or explored set**
  
  ****************************************************************************
  
  Depth-first search uses a LIFO queue. A LIFO queue means that the most 
  recently generated node is chosen for expansion. This must be the deepest 
  unexpanded node because it is one deeper than its parent-which, in turn, 
  was the deepest unexpanded node when it was selected.
  
  To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
  understand the search problem that is being passed in:
  
  print "Start:", problem.getStartState()
  print "Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState())
  print "Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState())
